🔐 JWT Authentication
🛡️ Role-Based Authorization
⚡ Redis Caching
📊 Monitoring Dashboard
🧾 Logging System
🧪 API Testing with Pytest
🖥️ Frontend Interface
🐳 Docker Support

🔄 Task Workflow Validation

Allowed task status transitions:

To Do → In Progress → Done

Invalid transitions are automatically rejected.

🔍 Task Filtering

Tasks can be filtered by:

status
priority
assignee_id

Example:

/tasks/?status=To Do&priority=high&assignee_id=1
🔐 Authentication
Features
User Registration
User Login
JWT Token Generation
Protected Endpoints
Token Validation
Notes
created_by is automatically extracted from the logged-in JWT user.
Employees can only update tasks assigned to them.
⚡ Redis Caching
Cache Strategy

The project uses the Cache-Aside Pattern:

Check cache first
If cache miss → fetch from database
Save result in cache
Return response
Cached Endpoints
GET all projects/tasks
GET project/task by ID
Filtered task queries
Cache Invalidation

Cache is automatically cleared after:

➕ Create
✏️ Update
❌ Delete
📊 Monitoring Dashboard
Endpoints
Method	Endpoint
GET	/monitoring
DELETE	/monitoring/reset
GET	/health
Monitoring Includes
📊 Total API requests
⏱️ Average response time
❌ Error count
📥 Recent requests
🚨 Recent errors
💚 System health status
🧪 API Testing

The project uses Pytest for automated API testing.
